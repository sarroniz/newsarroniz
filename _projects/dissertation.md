My dissertation examines the role of duration, voicing, and aspiration of the fricative segmental units in the categorical mappings of three novel allophones ([v], [รฐ] or [ษฃ]) in Western Andalusian Spanish (WAS). These phones results from the interplay of two phonological processes, the debuccalization of /s/ and spirantization of /b, d, g/. Previous studies suggest that a weakened /s/ followed by voiced stops is produced as singleton fricative (e.g., /sb/ -> [v]) in this dialect; a distinctive allophone compensating for the lenited /s/. I tested this in two different projects presented at two major conferences, one perceptually and one productively. Results from two different perceptual discrimination tasks revealed that Andalusians perceived a fricative realization of /b, d, g/ as plural, implying the perception of an /s/. This was corroborated with a speech and information gap production task, which showed that most tokens were produced with some frication observable in the higher frequencies. Preliminary data from my dissertation shows that duration and voicing are two acoustic cues that are used by WAS listeners to distinctively categorize the approximant vs. the compensatory allophonic fricative sound. This new resolution strategy of /s/ has major implications in the phonological system of WAS, as it now yields three discrete allophonic realizations derived from phonemic /b, d, g/, an occlusive, an approximant, and fricative when preceded by an elided /s/.
