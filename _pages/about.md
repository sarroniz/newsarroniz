I'm a dual Ph.D. student in `Hispanic Linguistics` and `Computational Linguistics` at Indiana University, Bloomington. I received my B.A. in English Studies and my M.A. in Linguistics, Literature, and Culture Studies both from University of Seville, Spain. After graduating, I moved to Bloomington, IN, where I completed my M.A. in Hispanic Linguistics, and where I also teach some undergraduate courses.

My research involve (1) the investigation of a compensatory allophony process though the use of a compensatory voiced fricative [ v, ð, ɣ ] in Western Andalusian Spanish, (2) the phonological investigation of suprasegmental aspects of Spanish, specifically the role of pitch height in the interpretation of sentence meaning, and (3) natural language processing, in particular automatic speech processing and classification of intonation and speaker variation. I work mainly with Andalusian, Castilian, and Caribbean Spanish. Other areas of interest include second language phonology, language attitudes, the phonology-syntax interface in constructions, dependency parsing, corpus analysis, and machine learning for natural language processing. I am also an active developer of _[SEÑAL](https://www.sarroniz.com/projects/SEÑAL/)_, an ongoing collaborative project intended to evaluate different components of essays written by L2 Spanish learners using NLP techniques.
