I am pleased to announce that I have been awarded the IU College of Arts and Sciences _Dissertation Completion Fellowship_ for the academic year 2024/2025. This fellowship will allow me to spend time in Spain over the fall collecting data for my dissertation and finishing writing my dissertation, which is expected to be defended in May 2025. I would like to publicly thank the donors for this generous award.
