## Abstract

This paper presents preliminary work on a grammar checker for students and instructors of Spanish as a second language. Spanish is a Romance language with a high degree of com- plexity in verb inflections and homonymy, pos- ing an added challenge for L2 learners when acquiring grammar and/or vocabulary. This project intends to be a computer-based assis- tive tool for the L2 language classroom to pro- vide rich and accurate feedback on students’ compositions. The pipeline consists of a sim- ple spell checker, a finite-state morphological analyzer and constraint grammar, as well as a frequency-based evaluation tool that analyses the lexical and grammatical complexity of the text.
